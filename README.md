# Feed-the-Cat-Sratch-project
This is a laboratory work on the program of the course CH50
The project must meet a number of requirements:
- project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture.
